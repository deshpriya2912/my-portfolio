     	Hey there! I am <strong>Nitesh Sharma</strong> currently pursuing B.tech in computer science at <a href="http://www.mnit.ac.in/" target="_blank">MNIT Jaipur</a> (2018-2022). I am a coding enthusiast and a front end developer. Apart from these, I have a good command on data structures and Algorithms where lies the heart of computer science. Logical problem solving has always appealed to me and this explains my interests in mathematics, programming and computing in general. Although, the decision to study computer science was not a simple one but My desire for solving challenging problems therefore led to my choice of studying computer science.My profile looks interesting? Wish to know more about me ? refer below:

     	<p class="textss" style="display: inline-block;width:60%;">I studied at my village till 3rd standard and then I moved to Jaipur city in hope for quality education even though academics in rural areas is not bad but yes, people in our society doesn't mark it with good ratings and every parent wants their children to study at english medium school, isn't it? This story so far of a simple village boy bores you, then you may want to look into my competetive coding journey so far. If you haven't moved forward then I think you may want to hear me more, I have never been an excellent student in academics, got 9.2 cgpa &#9996; &#9996; in 10th grade but only able to manage 75.6 percent marks in 12th class &#128541; &#128541;, I have always tried to keep a balance between studies and sports, a good runner, always been among those students who wish to go to playground in each and every class, likes to play cricket and volleyball and even at some point of time in past, I wished to play professional cricket  but then dropped that idea, anyways that's a long story.

     		Well at first give it a thought, how a student with only 75% marks in 12th managed to secure AIR 3280 in Jee Mains and AIR 7607 in Jee Advanced...ok..ok...ok I know I am not the only one who has done this but yes I'll say it's not that easy as it looks reading by, I joined Allen Jaipur as a dropper student. Well, the earlier days in coaching didn't went well, even after preparing thouroughly for monthly tests, I wasn't able to get into top 100 out of only 500, yes it was demotivating but I kept on trying. Of course, I can write a kind of long essay on my struggle at Allen but no I'll try to quickly finish it with my own words that <i>success comes after failures and struggle and your hard work will pay you some day</i> for sure in your life and I am really thankful to god that I at least got enough marks to take admission at MNIT.

     		I started coding in 3rd semester when I heard talks of my peers and friends regarding competetive coding and how important role it plays in the life of a Software engineer. I started coding in python but quickly switched to c++ as advised my mentors and seniors at college because python is way easier than many other object oriented programming languages. I didn't found myself comfortable in coding at start when I was not even able to solve very basic problems that now seems a joke to me so, hopefully things have changed a lot with time, at least now I can say that I am a 4 star coder at <a title="Click on the link to visit my profile" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/niteshsharma5" target="_blank">Codechef</a> and that might seem to be average to you but I know that I've really learnt many new things in last 6-7 months. Anyways, I'll say that there is no alternative to hard work and that is the only that can make you rise and help you find the way to your dream. Well, I have simple dreams to get a good job in some MNC and then look into other things further in life. By the way, I forgot to tell you that I've also earned 6 stars on
